### LESS

LESS was used as the language extension for CSS

#### To watch for changes and automatically compile changes into index.css:

1. Open your terminal and verify that LESS is installed correctly and running by running `lessc -v` in your terminal.
2. In your terminal navigate to the styles folder (`portfolio/src/styles`).
3. Run `less-watch-compiler less css index.less` in your terminal.
4. Verify your compiler is working correctly by making a change in the index.less file then check to ensure the corresponding change is in the index.css file.
